## Unlock Targeted Marketing Insights!

## Experience the app live:  customer-segmentation-app-by-saniya.streamlit.app/

## üåü Overview

SegmentWise is an interactive web application that leverages Unsupervised Machine Learning to reveal distinct groups within a customer base.

By automatically clustering customers based on key behavioral and demographic features, this tool provides businesses with actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies, targeted promotions, and optimized resource allocation.

## ‚ú® Features & FunctionalityCustom Data Upload: 

Users can upload their own customer data via a CSV file to perform segmentation.

Dynamic Feature Selection: Allows users to select any two numeric features (e.g., Age, Annual Income, Spending Score) for clustering.

Optimal Cluster Analysis: The app likely incorporates the Elbow Method to recommend the best number of clusters ($K$), a crucial step in the K-Means process.

Clustering Visualization: Displays a dynamic scatter plot that visualizes the customer groups, with each segment color-coded for clarity.

## üíª Technologies & Libraries

This project is built entirely in Python using the following essential libraries for machine learning and web deployment:

Streamlit: The primary framework for building the interactive UI and deploying the web application.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): Essential for the implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm and core data preprocessing steps.

Pandas: Used for data analysis, cleaning, and handling the uploaded datasets (CSV files).

Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn: Used to generate crucial visualizations, including the Elbow Method plot (to find the optimal $K$) and the dynamic scatter plots for cluster visualization.

pickle or joblib: Used for saving and loading the trained K-Means model or any fitted data scalers.
